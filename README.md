# Insider Threat Detection System  


## Overview

Insider threats are one of the most challenging problems in cybersecurity because malicious behavior is **rare, subtle, and usually unlabeled**. Traditional rule-based systems fail to generalize, and supervised ML is impractical due to the lack of labeled attack data.

This project implements an **end-to-end Insider Threat Detection System** that:
- Learns **normal employee behavior** from activity logs
- Detects anomalous users using **unsupervised machine learning**
- Converts anomaly scores into **explainable risk scores**
- Presents results in a **SOC-style dashboard** for security analysts

---

## Problem Statement

> How can we detect malicious insiders when:
> - Attacks are rare  
> - There are no labels  
> - Behavior looks normal until it suddenly doesn’t  

### Key Challenges
- No labeled insider threat data
- High false positives with rule-based detection
- Need for explainability in security decisions

---

## Solution Approach

We treat insider threat detection as an **anomaly detection problem**:

- Model *normal* employee behavior
- Detect deviations from the baseline
- Assign interpretable risk scores
- Surface alerts to analysts via a dashboard

---

## Machine Learning Models

### Isolation Forest
- Efficient unsupervised anomaly detection
- Works well for large datasets
- Identifies globally rare patterns

### One-Class SVM
- Learns a boundary around normal behavior
- Detects subtle deviations
- Complements Isolation Forest

### Why Two Models?
Using multiple unsupervised models reduces false positives and improves robustness.

## Risk Scoring Engine

Instead of exposing raw ML scores, the system computes an **explainable risk score**:

Risk Score =
0.35 × Isolation Forest Score

0.35 × One-Class SVM Score

0.20 × Sensitive File Access

0.10 × Failed Logins


This bridges the gap between **ML output and security decision-making**.
